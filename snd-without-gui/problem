It seems that the ubuntu apt-get "snd", which runs with GUI, lacks some basical functions
(regarding hooks, sound edit...)

on the other side the compiled version runs fine, also without GUIs BUT when executing the binary, it requires the following files:
libc_s7.so
s7.h

To be in the same folder FROM WHICH IT WAS CALLED.
I tried to compile them too, to integrate them to the compiled binary and to set them to "/usr/shared" whatever, but I'm no expert plus didn't try very hard.

So what I did is copy them to home and call emacs always from home. This is dirty but I left here all necessary to do it properly in future settings if necessary
